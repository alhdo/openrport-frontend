# OpenRport UI

- [Documentation](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/getting-started)

Welcome to the new UI of OpenRport, an open-source remote server manager without the hassle of VPNs. This project is designed using Nuxt 3 to create a seamless and responsive user interface for managing remote systems securely.

## Getting started
---

### Install
```
git clone git@github.com:openrport/openrport-ui.git
cd openrport-ui
yarn install
```


### Configuration

Start to fill out your env file. The most import variable is `NUXT_API_URL`
That should be the url of your Openrport instance.

```
cp .env.example .env
yarn dev

```

### Credits
